## Final Code 

Based on the report and the given code, here's the organized code with docstrings and comments for each section to match the report structure:

```python
# Introduction
# This section provides a brief overview of the problem of computing the factorial of a non-negative integer and introduces the solution through a Python function named `factorial`. The function is designed to handle non-negative integers and raises a ValueError for negative inputs. An example of how to use the function is also provided, demonstrating the computation of the factorial of 5.

## Function Definition

def factorial(n):
    """
    Computes the factorial of a given non-negative integer n.
    
    Parameters:
    n (int): A non-negative integer whose factorial is to be computed.
    
    Returns:
    int: The factorial of n.
    """
    
    ## Input Validation
    # The code snippet validates the input argument `n` to ensure it is a non-negative integer.
    # If `n` is less than zero, indicating a negative value, a `ValueError` is raised.
    # This validation step is crucial for preventing errors in subsequent computations.
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Input must be a non-negative integer")
    
    ## Factorial Calculation
    # This section details the iterative approach to calculate the factorial of a number `n`.
    # The factorial of a number `n`, denoted as `n!`, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`.
    # The code initializes `result` to `1`, serving as the starting point for multiplication.
    # It then enters a for loop, iterating from `2` to `n + 1`.
    # In each iteration, the current value of `result` is multiplied by the loop variable `i`, effectively accumulating the product.
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    
    ## Return Statement
    # The `return result` statement signifies the end of the function execution and sends back the value of the variable `result` to the caller.
    return result

# Example Usage
# Example of how to use the function in a script.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = 5
    print(f"The factorial of {n} is {factorial(n)}")
```
