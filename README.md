# AgenticAi_on_production

 I feel like it would be interesting if I just Deploy what I learnt through the process of learning Agentic AI. here is a complete detailed approach if some one wants to deploy Agentic ai applications on to cloud in my case (AWS). I have documented it so that it will be lot helpful for me in the future as well as someone who wants to who is research on this.

  So I used modular coding techniques( Making every function as a supporter Python file and importing when required) to integrate all functions in the case of Agentic AI Tools, Agent's , Building graphs etc.. made individual Python files and imported it according to the requirements. It made a lot of tasks easy in terms of debugging and Clarity of code.
