### Problem Statement:

Given a positive integer \( n \), write a function that determines whether \( n \) is a prime number. A prime number is defined as a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. Your function should return `true` if \( n \) is a prime number, and `false` otherwise.

### Example:

- Input: \( n = 7 \)
- Output: `true`
- Explanation: 7 is a prime number because its only divisors are 1 and 7.

- Input: \( n = 10 \)
- Output: `false`
- Explanation: 10 is not a prime number because it has divisors other than 1 and itself (2 and 5).

### Constraints:

- \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^6 \)

Your task is to implement the function efficiently, considering the given constraints.
## test_cases 

Sure, here are five test cases that cover a variety of scenarios, including edge cases and complex situations, for the problem statement given.

1. **Test case 1:**  
   **Input:** 1  
   **Output:** `false`  
   **Explanation:** The number 1 is not considered a prime number as it does not meet the criteria of having exactly two distinct positive divisors.  
   
2. **Test case 2:**  
   **Input:** 2  
   **Output:** `true`  
   **Explanation:** The number 2 is the smallest prime number, as it has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and 2 itself.  
   
3. **Test case 3:**  
   **Input:** 999983  
   **Output:** `true`  
   **Explanation:** 999983 is a large prime number, which tests the efficiency and correctness of the prime-checking function for large inputs.  
   
4. **Test case 4:**  
   **Input:** 999999  
   **Output:** `false`  
   **Explanation:** 999999 is not a prime number (it is divisible by 3 and other numbers), and it serves as a boundary test case to see how the function handles the upper limit of the constraint.  
   
5. **Test case 5:**  
   **Input:** 4  
   **Output:** `false`  
   **Explanation:** The number 4 is not a prime number because it has divisors other than 1 and itself (2), which makes it a composite number. This test case is simple but important to verify the basic functionality of the prime-checking logic.

Certainly! Here's a problem statement tailored for the development or explanation of a factorial function or code:

---

**Problem Statement:**

Given a positive integer \( n \), write a function to compute the factorial of \( n \). The factorial of a non-negative integer \( n \) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to \( n \). It is denoted by \( n! \) and defined as:
\[ n! = n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \times ... \times 1 \]
For example, the factorial of 5 (\( 5! \)) is 120 because \( 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120 \).

**Requirements:**
- The function should handle positive integers.
- The function should return the factorial of the given number.
- Consider the limitations of the data type you are using to return the factorial, as factorials can grow very large very quickly.
- Provide a solution that is efficient in terms of both time and space complexity.

**Example:**
- Input: 5
- Output: 120

**Constraints:**
- \( 0 \leq n \leq 20 \) (to prevent overflow in most common data types)
- The solution should be able to compute the factorial of \( n \) within a reasonable time frame.

Your task is to write a function or method that meets the above requirements and ensures it correctly computes the factorial for the given input range.
## test_cases 

Certainly! Here are five test cases designed to cover the requirements and edge cases for a factorial function as described in the problem statement:

**Test Case 1:**
- Input: 0
- Output: 1
- Explanation: The factorial of 0 is defined as 1. This test case ensures that the function correctly handles the base case where \( n = 0 \).

**Test Case 2:**
- Input: 1
- Output: 1
- Explanation: The factorial of 1 is 1. This test case checks the behavior of the function for the smallest positive integer, which is a special case.

**Test Case 3:**
- Input: 5
- Output: 120
- Explanation: A typical case to check the correctness of the function for a number that is not a boundary case. This ensures that the function can handle typical inputs correctly.

**Test Case 4:**
- Input: 20
- Output: 2432902008176640000
- Explanation: This is the upper limit as per the constraints. It checks whether the function can handle the largest value within the constraints and correctly computes the factorial for larger numbers. This case is also useful to ensure that the data type used to store the factorial result does not overflow.

**Test Case 5:**
- Input: 10
- Output: 3628800
- Explanation: This test case is chosen to check mid-range values and to validate the correctness of the computation for numbers that are neither too small nor too large. This ensures that the function maintains efficiency and correctness across the input range.

Each test case is designed to check different aspects of the function, from its base case handling to its ability to manage larger inputs efficiently. These test cases should help ensure that the implementation of the factorial function is robust and accurate.

## generate code 

Based on the problem statement provided, here's a Python solution that calculates the factorial of a given non-negative integer \( n \). This solution uses an iterative approach to compute the factorial, which is efficient and avoids potential stack overflow issues that might arise with a recursive approach for large values of \( n \).

```python
def factorial(n):
    """
    Computes the factorial of a given non-negative integer n.
    
    Parameters:
    n (int): A non-negative integer whose factorial is to be computed.
    
    Returns:
    int: The factorial of n.
    """
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Input must be a non-negative integer")
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = 5
    print(f"The factorial of {n} is {factorial(n)}")
```

### Explanation:
- **Function Definition**: The function `factorial` takes an integer `n` as an argument and returns the factorial of `n`.
- **Input Validation**: The function checks if `n` is a non-negative integer. If `n` is negative, it raises a `ValueError`.
- **Factorial Calculation**: An iterative approach is used to calculate the factorial. The variable `result` is initialized to 1, and then it multiplies itself by each integer from 2 to `n`, updating `result` in each iteration.
- **Return Statement**: After the loop, the function returns the calculated factorial value of `n`.

This solution ensures that the computation is handled efficiently and correctly for non-negative integers up to 20, as specified in the constraints.
## polish_code 

Based on the provided problem statement and the given Python code for calculating the factorial, let's identify potential test cases that could expose scenarios where the code might fail or not work as expected according to the problem statement.

### Test Case 1:
- **input**: -1
- **output**: ValueError: Input must be a non-negative integer
- **explanation**: The function correctly raises a ValueError for negative input, which is within the requirement that the function should handle only non-negative integers.

### Test Case 2:
- **input**: 0
- **output**: 1
- **explanation**: Factorial of 0 is defined as 1, which the function should handle correctly.

### Test Case 3:
- **input**: 20
- **output**: 2432902008176640000
- **explanation**: The solution should correctly compute the factorial of 20, as specified in the problem statement, which is within the constraint of \( 0 \leq n \leq 20 \).

### Test Case 4:
- **input**: 21
- **output**: ?
- **explanation**: Although the function does not explicitly check for the upper limit (20) and could technically compute the factorial of 21, this input is outside the specified constraint range in the problem statement. However, the function does not currently handle this case explicitly, and depending on the data type used, this computation may lead to a data type overflow or exceed reasonable computational limits.

Given the constraints in the problem statement and the provided code, the code seems to address the outlined requirements effectively. However, Test Case 4 highlights a scenario where the input is outside the specified constraint but the code does not enforce this limit.

Therefore, the only potential "failed" test case, in the sense of not being explicitly handled, is:

**Test Case 4:**
- **input**: 21
- **output**: The output might not be as expected or could lead to an overflow.
- **explanation**: The input is out of the specified constraint range (0 to 20) in the problem statement, and while the function will compute a result, this scenario is not explicitly managed in the function.

No other failed test cases exist under the given constraints and the provided code.
## review_code 

Improvements in code for failed test cases : Add a condition to raise an error or return an appropriate message for inputs greater than 20, as per the problem statement constraints.
Suggestions to make code according to problem statement : The current code handles non-negative integers well and calculates the factorial correctly within the specified range. No changes are needed for functionality within the constraints. However, to strictly adhere to the problem statement, it's advisable to add input validation for numbers greater than 20. This can be done by adding a condition to check if \( n > 20 \) and raising an appropriate error or message.
## Improve code 

Based on the problem statement and the suggestions, the code needs to be updated to adhere more strictly to the constraints, particularly to handle inputs greater than 20 properly. Hereâ€™s the improved version of the code:

```python
def factorial(n):
    """
    Computes the factorial of a given non-negative integer n.
    
    Parameters:
    n (int): A non-negative integer whose factorial is to be computed.
    
    Returns:
    int: The factorial of n if 0 <= n <= 20.
    
    Raises:
    ValueError: If n is negative or greater than 20.
    """
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Input must be a non-negative integer")
    if n > 20:
        raise ValueError("Input must be less than or equal to 20 due to potential overflow or performance issues")
    
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = 5
    print(f"The factorial of {n} is {factorial(n)}")
```

### Explanation:
- **Input Validation**: The function now checks if `n` is greater than 20 and raises a `ValueError` in such cases. This ensures the function adheres to the specified constraints.
- **Factorial Calculation**: The iterative approach remains the same, ensuring the computation is both efficient and correct.
- **Example Usage**: The example usage remains unchanged, showing how to call the `factorial` function.

This updated code ensures that the constraints are properly enforced, preventing input values that are outside the specified range and providing clear error messages for such cases.
## polish_code 

Based on the problem statement and the given code, we can identify a few potential test cases that might cause the code to fail or behave unexpectedly. However, the provided solution is robust and should work well within the constraints provided (0 â‰¤ \( n \) â‰¤ 20). Here are some test cases that verify different aspects of the input and functionality:

test case 1:
input: 0
output: 1

explanation: The factorial of 0 should be 1 according to the mathematical definition, but the provided function does not explicitly handle this edge case. However, the loop starts from 2, which inherently handles 0 correctly, returning 1.

test case 2:
input: 20
output: 2432902008176640000

explanation: This is the largest number within the given constraint (0 â‰¤ \( n \) â‰¤ 20). The solution should handle this correctly, and the output is the correct factorial for 20.

test case 3:
input: -1
output: ValueError: Input must be a non-negative integer

explanation: The function correctly raises a ValueError for negative inputs, as specified in the validation check.

test case 4:
input: 21
output: None (or any other non-integer value)

explanation: Although not within the problem's stated constraints (0 â‰¤ \( n \) â‰¤ 20), this test checks the behavior for values just outside the expected range. The function will not raise an error but will compute a value beyond the typical integer limits, which may not be accurate due to integer overflow in some languages. However, Python's integer type can handle large numbers, so this case is more about adherence to the problem's constraints rather than a failure of the function.

Given these considerations, the only scenario where the provided code might not work according to the problem statement is when the input is outside the specified range, particularly when it's a negative number (which it correctly handles by raising an error). For all other valid inputs within the constraint, the function should work as expected. Therefore, we can conclude:

no failed test cases

The function is designed to handle inputs correctly within the constraints and raises an error for invalid inputs, thus adhering to the problem statement.

## Introduction
This section provides a brief overview of the problem of computing the factorial of a non-negative integer and introduces the solution through a Python function named `factorial`. The function is designed to handle non-negative integers and raises a ValueError for negative inputs. An example of how to use the function is also provided, demonstrating the computation of the factorial of 5.

---

### Function Definition

```python
def factorial(n):
    """
    Computes the factorial of a given non-negative integer n.
    
    Parameters:
    n (int): A non-negative integer whose factorial is to be computed.
    
    Returns:
    int: The factorial of n.
    """
```

---

### Input Validation

The code snippet validates the input argument `n` to ensure it is a non-negative integer. If `n` is less than zero, indicating a negative value, a `ValueError` is raised with a message specifying that the input must be a non-negative integer. This validation step is crucial for preventing errors in subsequent computations that assume `n` to be non-negative.

---

### Factorial Calculation

This section details the iterative approach to calculate the factorial of a number `n`. The factorial of a number `n`, denoted as `n!`, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`. For instance, `5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120`.

The code initializes `result` to `1`, serving as the starting point for multiplication. It then enters a for loop, iterating from `2` to `n + 1`. In each iteration, the current value of `result` is multiplied by the loop variable `i`, effectively accumulating the product. This method iteratively builds the factorial value until the loop completes, at which point `result` holds the final factorial value of `n`.

---

### Return Statement

The `return result` statement signifies the end of the function execution and sends back the value of the variable `result` to the caller. This is particularly useful after a loop, where the loop may have processed some data or performed computations, and the final result is then returned for further use or analysis outside of the function.

---

### Example Usage
Example of how to use the function in a script.

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = 5
    print(f"The factorial of {n} is {factorial(n)}")
```
