It looks like you might have abbreviated or haven't provided a complete prompt or code snippet for me to generate a problem statement. Could you please provide more details? For example, if you are referring to a code that deals with "koti," which is a term often used in Hindi meaning "crore" (10 million), you might need a problem statement related to handling large numbers, currency conversions, or numerical operations in specific contexts. Please provide more context or a specific code snippet so I can assist you better.
## test_cases 

Sure, I can help with that. However, I need more information about the problem you want to generate test cases for. Since no specific problem was provided, I'll create a hypothetical problem for demonstration purposes. Let's say the problem is about a function that converts a number of crores (koti) to its equivalent in millions. Here's a problem statement for that:

**Problem Statement:**
Write a function `convertCroresToMillions(crores)` that takes an integer `crores` representing the number of crores and returns the equivalent number in millions. Note that 1 crore is equal to 10 million.

Now, here are the test cases for the above problem statement:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `convertCroresToMillions(2)`
   - Output: `20`
   - Explanation: 2 crores is equivalent to 20 million (2 * 10).

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `convertCroresToMillions(0)`
   - Output: `0`
   - Explanation: 0 crores is equivalent to 0 million.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `convertCroresToMillions(5)`
   - Output: `50`
   - Explanation: 5 crores is equivalent to 50 million (5 * 10).

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `convertCroresToMillions(100)`
   - Output: `1000`
   - Explanation: 100 crores is equivalent to 1000 million (100 * 10).

5. **Test Case 5:**
   - Input: `convertCroresToMillions(-10)`
   - Output: `-100`
   - Explanation: -10 crores is equivalent to -100 million (-10 * 10). This tests the function's behavior with negative inputs, which could be relevant depending on the context of the function.

These test cases should cover the basic and edge cases for the problem statement provided. Please let me know if you have another specific problem in mind or if these examples meet your requirements.
